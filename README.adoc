## Installation
    Keycloak + DB setup:
        Run docker-compose.yml inside keycloak directory

    Build application:
        ./gradlew clean build

    Run application

    Application is running on port: 8701

## Keycloak configuration
    Create realm (test)

    Create confidential client (backend) and set Access Type to confidential
        - Enable Service Accounts Enabled
        - Set Valid Redirect URIs and Web Origins to *
    Create public client (client-public)
        - Set Access type to public
        - Set Valid Redirect URIs and Web Origins to *

    Create realm roles (admin and user)

    Create users (admin and user)
    Select user admin and under Role Mappings assign role admin
    Select user user and under Role Mappings assign role user

## REST API Application

    Two secured APIs
        - /admin/test
        - /user/test

    One public (unsecured API)
        - /public/test

## Application configuration

Inside application.properties Change *credentials.secret* based on *backend* client configuration inside Keycloak.

## Postman - Get token

Under authorization select OAuth 2.0 and click "Get New Access Token".

    Auth url:
    http://localhost:18080/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/auth

    Access token URL:
    http://localhost:18080/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/token

## Extras

- Keycloak doesn't allow "bearer only" clients to obtain tokens from the server.
  Change your client to "confidential" on the server and set bearer-only on your adapter configuration.

- Usually we would use "bearer only" for REST API applications.
